Catch-phrase description of my own self: seasoned inconspicuous writer who – as the Elton John line goes – wide-eyed roams the night in search of beauty and love.
Actual description of my (boring) own self: natural bookworm with a very keen eye for details. I was born and raised in a provincial town in Northern Italy, which is to say, that part of the country that is neither Florence, nor Venice, nor Rome."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><meta name=theme-color content="black"><link rel=canonical href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/about/><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Merriweather:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,300;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><link rel=stylesheet href=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css integrity=sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh crossorigin=anonymous><title>This is me! :: Unrequested tailor-made opinions — Hello Friend NG Theme</title><link href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flag-icon-css/3.2.1/css/flag-icon.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/main.min.22c2a92ce3eff7ccc2e275129e899775cbb0b21902e249dbf70982f75e04be2b.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=manifest href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/site.webmanifest><link rel=mask-icon href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg color=black><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://elisateneggi.github.io/favicon.ico><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="black"><meta name=theme-color content="black"><meta itemprop=name content="This is me!"><meta itemprop=description content="“I can scarcely bid you good bye, even in a letter.

I always made an awkward bow.”</em>- John Keats (November 30, 1820)</p><p>Catch-phrase description of my own self: seasoned inconspicuous writer who – as the Elton John line goes – wide-eyed roams the night in search of beauty and love.</p><p>Actual description of my (boring) own self: natural bookworm with a very keen eye for details. I was born and raised in a provincial town in Northern Italy, which is to say, that part of the country that is neither Florence, nor Venice, nor Rome. It gets unbearably hot in the summer, and winters are damp and freezing. But let’s move on to happier times.</p><p>After earning my BA (Hons) and my first MA in Foreign Languages and Literatures (English &amp; German) from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, I moved to Scotland to start off a career in Film Studies, which I am currently studying at the University of Edinburgh. Though I have always been utterly dedicated to my academic pursuits, I started contributing to various amateur blogs to let that creative steam off – which only made me more aware of how big a role writing played in my everyday life. As a way to foster my bonds with the artistic community at large, I both took up volunteer roles at art festivals – notably Glasgow Film Festival and BookCity Milano – and joined Edinburgh-based film community Cinetopia as freelance copywriter. As a result, I have grown very fond of (film) festivals, and I intend to work my way up to programming/coordinating positions once I graduate at the end of the year.</p><p>On the side line, I produce original fictional &amp; non-fictional written content on my own – you will find bits and pieces of it scattered across the website.
And now for the unserious stuff. I have an Instagram profile where I compulsively post badly-edited pictures of people, places, and food, and if you take a close look at the feed, you will find my face carefully hidden among everything else. I am definitely a Mrs. Dalloway when it comes to party hosting – in fact, I love gathering friends around a well-set table for cheering laughter, Bundt cake, and a couple of cocktails. I cherish sitting in sun-lit Parisian cafés, wondering how unpleasant the world would be without hot chocolate and butter sablés. I like words, very much indeed, and I believe in their weird, unsettling power. That is why I respect them, and use them with care. That is why I write, I suppose. That is the reason why you are still reading this.</p><h2 id=adventure-awaits>Adventure awaits</h2></div></div></article><div class=post-info></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://elisateneggi.github.io/bundle.min.2d5469329143160ae2456a69c3c76dc2d0a3b212b46afe291a51bd68650ed6f8697e001dab54f1c272c77ce08092a8c55e5bb4314e0ee334aab4b927ec896638.js integrity="sha512-LVRpMpFDFgriRWppw8dtwtCjshK0av4pGlG9aGUO1vhpfgAdq1TxwnLHfOCAkqjFXlu0MU4O4zSqtLkn7IlmOA=="></script><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6 crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://kit.fontawesome.com/8be9e0f662.js crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
